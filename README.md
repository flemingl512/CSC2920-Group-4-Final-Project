This document entails the details of a visual studio program that will be used to schedule and view appointments. The goal is to have a
visual program that allows a user to set and view appointments for ease of use. The user will be able to add themselves to an appointment
list as well as view and remove themselves at their discretion. There will also be the functionality of a login/registry further down the
line in development (version 2).

With the advent of the digital age has brought on the need to modernize and improve every aspect of business, one such improvement needed
is the way in which we set our schedules. The objective is to design a program that has a registry of names that can be accessed by clients
of a company, so that they may set their own schedules and appointments without the need of going through a third party or office to set
the appointments
